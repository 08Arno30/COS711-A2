## Introduction

This project involves developing a neural network (NN) to classify almonds into three different types based on numeric features extracted from their images. The dataset contains a variety of almond samples, with the purpose of accurately categorising them using machine learning techniques. To accomplish this, the following steps are necessary:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for optimal results during training.
2. **Hyperparameter Optimisation**: Fine-tuneÂ the neural network's hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.
3. **A Comparative Study of Gradient-Based Algorithms**: Evaluate the performance of several gradient-based optimisation strategies to determine the most effective strategy for training the NN.
4. **Hybrid Training Algorithm**: Create a new algorithm that uses gradient information from other optimisation approaches to increase convergence and performance.

The project's goal with these steps is to develop a strong classification model while also investigating advanced training approaches.
