        "This project involves developing a neural network (NN) to classify almonds into three different types based on numeric features extracted from their images. The dataset contains a variety of almond samples, with the purpose of accurately categorising them using machine learning techniques. To accomplish this, the following steps are necessary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for optimal results during training.\n",
        "2. **Hyperparameter Optimisation**: Fine-tuneÂ the neural network's hyperparameters to improve classification accuracy.\n",
        "3. **A Comparative Study of Gradient-Based Algorithms**: Evaluate the performance of several gradient-based optimisation strategies to determine the most effective strategy for training the NN.\n",
        "4. **Hybrid Training Algorithm**: Create a new algorithm that uses gradient information from other optimisation approaches to increase convergence and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project's goal with these steps is to develop a strong classification model while also investigating advanced training approaches."
